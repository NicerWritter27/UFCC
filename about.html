<h4 class="ui inverted header">About</h4>
				<p>This is a simple extension designed to create <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> fractions. There are only a few
					fractions built-in to the Unicode standard, which are very limited. This extension will automatically create fractions using
					superscript & subscript characters, that can be copied & pasted into text messages, social media
					posts, emails, or anything else that accepts text.</p>
